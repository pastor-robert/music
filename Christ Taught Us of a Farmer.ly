Christ taught us of a farm -- er who went out sow -- ing seeds.
A few had trou -- ble grow -- ing a -- mong the rocks and weeds.
But oth -- ers grew till har -- vest in soil that was so good.
O God, you sow the gos -- pel: The seed is your own word.

In times of joy we praise you, in strug -- gl -- ing times we search,
And al -- ways we are learn -- ing to be your faith -- ful church.
O Spir -- it, make us o -- pen, with hearts and lives made new,
To un -- der -- stand the gos -- pel and then, to fol -- low you.
