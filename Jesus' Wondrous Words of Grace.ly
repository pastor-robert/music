Je -- sus' won -- drous words of grace
Wel -- come all to God's em -- brace:
Wel -- come if you're rich or poor,
If you're knock -- ing at the door,
If you come from far a -- way,
If you need a place to stay.
If you suf -- fer want or pain,
You are wel -- come in God's reign!
}

VerseB = \lyricmode {
  \set stanza = "2. "
Do you live in fear and doubt?
Do you seek to leave some out?
Do you think that some can't get
To the ta -- ble God has set?
Think there is no room for you?
Je -- sus says you're wel -- come, too.
Think you're dif -- fer -- ent, sin -- ful, odd?
You are wel -- come, child of God!
}

VerseC = \lyricmode {
  \set stanza = "3. "
Je -- sus says to all the church:
Wel -- come in the ones who search,
Wel -- come in the ones who mourn,
Wel -- come in the tired and worn,
Wel -- come those who live in fear,
Wel -- come in the sin -- ners here.
As you do to these, you see,
So you al -- so wel -- come me.
